# Project-Banking-App

Description:


Leveraging Java 8, this application simulates a customer registering for an account with a bank.


Details:


-	Built this application using Java 8;
-	All interaction with the user should be done through the console using the Scanner class.
-	Customers of the bank should be able to register with a username and password, and apply to open an account.
-	Customers should be able to apply for joint accounts
-	Once the account is open, customers should be able to withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds between accounts (Savings account)
-	All basic validation should be done, such as trying to input negative amounts, overdrawing from accounts etc.
-	Employees of the bank should be able to view all of their customers information
-	This includes, account information, Account balances, and Personal information
-	Employees should be able to approve/deny open applications for accounts


Bank admins should be able to view and edit all accounts
This includes:

•	Approving/denying accounts
•	withdrawing, depositing, transferring from all accounts
•	canceling accounts
•	JUnit testing is expected
•	Logging was accomplished using Log4J
•	All transactions are logged

-	Create an SQL script that will create a user in an SQL database and a table schema for storing your bank users and account information.
-	Your database should include at least 1 stored procedure.
-	Have your bank application connect to your SQL database using JDBC and store all information that way.
-	You should use the DAO design pattern for data connectivity.


This Output includes an example of a customer's information being stored in a database after registering for an account with the bank :
